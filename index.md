I am a CS major and a student at CSUF, and I expect to graduate in 2027 to 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Lab 7
This lab was where things started to get a bit more engaging, so this was listed as one of the labs that I had fun in. Paired with two people, we had to write a program that determines if street parking on a specific street is allowed at a certain time and day. Varying streets, hours, days of the week, and all sorts had to be considered, and after using IF, AND, and OR statements so many times, it became satisfying to finally have every part of it work.

Lab 8, Part 2
This is one of my favorite lab parts as it’s simple while fun to see it get created. We had to build an entire square filled with patterns of text using for loops, then using nested for loops to make a certain pattern per line. It’s fun as I considered every variable accounted for, and when you complete it, you get to see it yourself.

Lab 12
This is my favorite lab because it’s the part where I finally get to see the works myself in color. For both parts, we had to use GraphicsMagick and create a gif. Part 1 displayed varying amounts of animated gradients that change those loops perfectly. Part 2 displayed a beautiful noise along with a text that spells out anything that we want. Both were visually cool to look at.
